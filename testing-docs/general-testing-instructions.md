## Testing general instructions

1. When testing, make sure to watch for errors that show up while running the application. These errors will either pause the website and have a very obvious popup or there will be an error sign in the bottom left corner of the screen. Whenever these show up, take a screenshot and document steps to replicate the error. Be as specific as possible

2. Some testing will require running both the shop and the admin portal at the same time. In this case, make sure to confirm which branch must be tested in both repositories first.

3. If there is ever a need for clarification, DO NOT hesitate to ask for help.
