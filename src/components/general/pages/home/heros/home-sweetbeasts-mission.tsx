Each one of our creations encourages a balanced diet and a healthier lifestyle. We foster a community that strives to make the world a better place. A portion of all our sales are donated to a variety of hunger and wild-life charities of your choice. We also team up with local childrenâ€™s nonprofits to donate our plushies to bring comfort and joy to children who need it most. Each purchase is a step towards building a more caring, connected, and healthier world." />
